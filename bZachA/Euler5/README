Euler 5 doesn't even require a computer, you could calculate it by hand.

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


so for 1 to 10 you just need to multiply together all the common prime factors.
 8 is 2 ^3, 9 is 3^2
 2 * 2 * 2  * 3 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 2520

so similarly for 1 to 20, go through the primes and multiply them together until the number you get is greater then 20,
then you have to include that many isntances minus 1 of that prime in the final product
2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16
3 * 3 = 9
every other prime will only occur once

2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232792560
